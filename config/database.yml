#   Install PostgreSQL using the url above, select the appropriate version, download it, double click the file, 
#   and install it using the defaults.
#       Once PostgreSQL is installed, check that there is a new user created, called Postgres and note the password, which is 
#       usually null.
#   Edit your path variable through Control Panel, System, Advanced, and Enviroment Variables.  Append ; and the path
#   to Postgres/bin.
#   Start a fresh Rails window and go back to the project folder.
#   Use rake db:create to create the database.
#   Use rails s to run.

# Configure Using Gemfile

# As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="postgres://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
#
production:
  <<: *default
  database: writers-website_production
  username: writers-website
  password: <%= ENV['WRITERS-WEBSITE_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
